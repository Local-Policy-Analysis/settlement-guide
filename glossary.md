# Glossary

These are many of the things that confused me. Hopefully these explanations help a little. If they're wrong, blame the people I asked to check them. 

## ASC Discharge Grant

A one-time grant for 2023 created to target issues with hospital discharge. 

## ASC Market Sustainability and Improvement Fund

Closely related to but distinct from the previous "Market Sustainability and Fair Cost of Care Fund", a pot of unringfenced money for LAs to help with increasing costs in Adult Social Care

## ASC Precept

The ASC Precept is an increase to council tax levels that any authority with responsibility for Adult Social Care can charge its inhabitants.  LAs with social care responsibility are:

- London Boroughs
- Unitary Authorities
- Metropolitan Districts
- Shire Counties

(Confusingly, most of these are not [Precepting Authorities](#precepting-authority).)

## Band D

Council Tax has Bands from A to H, and band D is in the middle. (Note, that does not make it the median band, because that would be too simple.) Other tax bands are often expressed in terms of Band D, e.g. Band H is 2 * Band D. 

## BFL

The Baseling Funding Level is the relative need to be funded by business rates for each local authority. It's not just a percentage of the total business rates they collect though, as this would mean that some authorities would not get enough money. Authorities which make a lot of business rates have some of their business rates redistributed (via a tariff) to less well off authorities (via a top-up). Most authorities retain 50% of the growth in business rates above BFLs, except councils that are part of increased business rates retention areas (pilots) who retain a larger share.

I really hope someone else who understands this better fills it in. I do not understand pilot schemes. James has read this now, and he *should* understand pilots.

## Billing Authority

A billing authority is an authority that actually collects Council Tax (or business rates). This can be for one of two reasons, either it's a [Unitary Authority](#unitary-authority), Metropolitan District or London Borough, or it's the lower tier of a two-tier authority (i.e. a shire district). 

For example, **Cumberland**, a [Unitary Authority](#unitary-authority) collects its own Tax and has no upper-level authority, however **Bromsgrove** is a Shire District in the Shire County of **Worcestershire**. Worcestershire doesn't collect Council Tax itself, however residents of Bromsgrove will pay Council Tax to their LA, who will send a share of the tax to Worcestershire. 

Apparently, it's very important to know that Billing authorities are in charge of bins.

## Business Rates

Tax on the occupation of non-residential property. Agriculture is exempt. Tax rate (known as the multiplier) set nationally, tax administered and collected locally.

## Core Spending Power

Core Spending Power is a constructed measure that attempts to capture the money that will be available to LAs from grants and council tax throughout the year. In general it's a comparison statistic that authorities can use to try to compare their non-education funding between years. 

We sum together the major non-education grants given to LAs through the year, and add an estimate of the council tax they will collect during the year. 

It doesn't *actually* give the amount of money they will recieve, as it estimates both the [Council Tax Base](#council-tax-base) and the council tax households will actually pay (see [Band D](#band-d)), and LAs will gain other grants, and be able to raise funds in other ways. However, we have calculated it in *basically* the same way since 2015, and so it gives a simple statistic for LAs to compare their funding between years.  

## Council Tax Base

The number of households in the LA who will pay council tax, usually expressed in terms of [Band D](#band-d) equivalents (e.g. a band H house is 2 [Band D](#band-d) equivalents). 

For Settlement we use the **Council Tax Base for Tax Setting Purposes** from the DLUHC council tax levels statistics, which is the tax base expressed in [Band D](#band-d) equivalents after allowing for losses on collection (people who should pay CT but don't). People often just refer to this as the tax base, which is not at all confusing.

## Equalisation Grant

Some authorities are able to raise more from a given increase in council tax levels than others because they have more high value properties. To adjust for this, both Social Care Grant and Improved Better Care Fund ([iBCF](#iBCF)) include an element of equalisation grant. To calculate this grant we first calculate how much each authority would get if the amount of money raised from the [ASC Precept](#asc-precpt) and equalisation grant were both distributed according to the ASC [RNF](#rnf). Any authority that already raises more than this amount from the [ASC Precept](#asc-precpt) does not get any equalistation grant. Any authority that does not receive enough gets equalisation grant.

## Fire Authority

Fire Authorities are one of the secret extra tiers of the two tier system. Fire responsibilities are often shared between authorities, and so an overarching fire authority recieves funding and provides services to the whole area. Fire authorities are a form of [Precepting Authority](#precepting-authority). A [Unitary Authority](#unitary-authority) or Shire County may also have responsibility for fire services.

## Funding Guarantee

For the 2023 settlement, the government promised that all LAs would receive at least a 3% increase in CSP, before having to increase council tax levels. The money for the funding guarantee is taken from services grant, which is part of the funding that the guarantee protects against making for lots of circular fun.

## iBCF

The improved Better Care Fund provides some of the funding for Adult Social Care, which authorities pool together with some NHS and health funding to fund their internal Better Care Fund (BCF). The BCF is a shared fund that the LA and the local health authority use to target adult social care. It was introduced in 

## London/GLA

London is its own special form of trouble, and has many wonderful exceptions. 

Specific to council tax, London has its own special three tier system. London Boroughs are [billing authorities](#billing-authority), and [asc precepts](#asc-precept). However they are also part of the GLA [precepting authority](#precepting-authority), which manages their fire services, gives TFL money and other exciting things. The GLA also provides policing for all of London except the City of London, and so every London Borough except the City of London pays additional council tax to a pseudo-precept to cover this.

## New Homes Bonus

NHB is a government grant to incentivise house building. The money for NHB is taken from the Local Government Departmental Expenditure Limit.

## Pilot Schemes

Some LAs give up some of their grants to keep more of their business rates. Also referred to as areas of increased business rates retention.

## Precepting Authority

"Precepting Authorities are generally the upper part of two-tier authorities, and one Precepting Authority will be made up of multiple [Billing Authorities](#billing-authority).  Precepting authorities do not collect council tax themselves, however the residents of the corresponding Billing Authorities pay a council tax bill which is split between the billing and precepting authorities. 

A billing authority can be part of several precepting authorities (for example a Shire District may be part of a Shire County, a Fire Precept, a Police Precept and a Park Precept). "

## Referendum Principles

Limits on how much local authorities can increase their council tax. Different types of local authorities can increase their council tax by different amounts. Currently (2023), if local authorities are [ASC precepts](#asc-precept) they can increase their council tax by an additional amount on top of the core referendum principle. Sometimes some authorities get to choose between increasing their council tax by a cash amount or by a percentage amount - usually whichever is larger.

## Reform

See [Rolled Over Grants](#rolled-over-grants)

## RNF

When we talk about RNF, we usually mean the Adult Social Care Relative Needs Formula. There are also other relative needs formulae that also just get called RNF, so it can sometimes be worth checking just to make sure!

The RNF tries to give a figure for the proportion of the overall country's need for adult social care is present in each area, based on the traditional "variety of factors". ASC RNFs are only assigned to [ASC Precepts](#asc-precept), and they should all add up to 1 (otherwise the total adult social care need would be more than the total adult social care need, and that doesn't make any sense.) 

This gets used to distribute quite a lot of ASC related grants, but not all of them, because that would be too simple.

## Rolled In Grants

Rolled in grants are grants which have been absorbed into another grant. They tend to be absorbed into [RSG](#rsg), but not always. The rolled in grant is no longer listed or calculated sepearately, and the funds that would have been awarded for it are instead added to the grant it has been rolled into. 

Easily confused with, but distinct from [Rolled Over Grants](#rolled-over-grants)

## Rolled Over Grants

Rolled over grants are the same from one year to the next (i.e. there isn't some formula to calculate them, and they haven't been [uprated](#uprating))

Easily confused with, but distinct from [Rolled In Grants](#rolled-in-grants)

## RSDG

Rural Services Delivery Grant does what it says on the tin!

## RSG

Revenue Support Grant is the main actual grant that forms the basis of the settlement. An original level was decided upon when this method of distribution started in 2013, and it's been slightly adjusted every year since. (When there's a [Rolled-in Grant](#rolled-in-grants), this is usually what it's rolled into).

## Services Grant

Grant allocated to all authorities on the basis of their 2013-14 Settlement Funding Assessment ([SFA](#sfa)).

## SFA

The Settlement Funding Assessment is [RSG](#rsg) + [BFL](#bfl). It was the core of the settlement when it was first set up. It's worked out by the SFA team!

## Shire County/Shire District

These are county councils. The Shire County is the [precepting authority](#precepting-authority), with the shire districts being the [billing authorities](#billing-authority).

## Social Care Grant

For all your social care needs! Social care grant aims to be distributed according to the [RNF](#rnf), and so Social Care Grant also contains an [equalisation grant](#equalisation-grant) in order to try and make the social care grant plus the money authorities raise from council tax by being [asc precepts](#asc-precept) match the RNF as much as possible.

## Underindexing

Once upon a time, we promised the LAs that we would increase BFLs by RPI. But we don't do that, it increases by CPI (or less than that if HMT intervenes), because RPI upsets the treasury. So we compensate LAs for this lost income via a Section 31 grant. This money features in CSP.

## Unitary Authority

Unitary Authorities are the best type of authorities. They do everything themselves, and are not split into tiers. That doesn't mean that they definitely don't have any [precepting authorities](#precepting-authority) though. They could still be part of a [fire authority](#fire-authority) for example.

## Uprating

For simplicity's sake, some grants are simply the distribution in a previous year multiplied by some factor. We say that these grants have been uprated by x%. If the factor is 1, then we say the grant was [rolled over](#rolled-over-grants).
